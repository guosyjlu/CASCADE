CBR_PROMPT = """You are a helpful AI assistant. Your task is to help generate Python code to solve the given task.
Here are some background knowledge and context information about the task to be solved.
(1) Tables are linked by identifiers which usually have the suffix 'ID'. For example, SUBJECT_ID refers to a unique patient, HADM_ID refers to a unique admission to the hospital, and ICUSTAY_ID refers to a unique admission to an intensive care unit.
(2) Charted events such as notes, laboratory tests, and fluid balance are stored in a series of 'events' tables. For example the outputevents table contains all measurements related to output for a given patient, while the labevents table contains laboratory test results for a patient.
(3) Tables prefixed with 'd_' are dictionary tables and provide definitions for identifiers. For example, every row of chartevents is associated with a single ITEMID which represents the concept measured, but it does not contain the actual name of the measurement. By joining chartevents and d_items on ITEMID, it is possible to identify the concept represented by a given ITEMID.
(4) For the databases, four of them are used to define and track patient stays: admissions, patients, icustays, and transfers. Another four tables are dictionaries for cross-referencing codes against their respective definitions: d_icd_diagnoses, d_icd_procedures, d_items, and d_labitems. The remaining tables, including chartevents, cost, inputevents_cv, labevents, microbiologyevents, outputevents, prescriptions, procedures_icd, contain data associated with patient care, such as physiological measurements, caregiver observations, and billing information.

For different tables, they contain the following information:
(1) admissions: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ADMITTIME, DISCHTIME, ADMISSION_TYPE, ADMISSION_LOCATION, DISCHARGE_LOCATION, INSURANCE, LANGUAGE, MARITAL_STATUS, ETHNICITY, AGE
(2) chartevents: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICUSTAY_ID, ITEMID, CHARTTIME, VALUENUM, VALUEUOM
(3) cost: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, EVENT_TYPE, EVENT_ID, CHARGETIME, COST
(4) d_icd_diagnoses: ROW_ID, ICD9_CODE, SHORT_TITLE, LONG_TITLE
(5) d_icd_procedures: ROW_ID, ICD9_CODE, SHORT_TITLE, LONG_TITLE
(6) d_items: ROW_ID, ITEMID, LABEL, LINKSTO
(7) d_labitems: ROW_ID, ITEMID, LABEL
(8) dianoses_icd: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICD9_CODE, CHARTTIME
(9) icustays: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICUSTAY_ID, FIRST_CAREUNIT, LAST_CAREUNIT, FIRST_WARDID, LAST_WARDID, INTIME, OUTTIME
(10) inputevents_cv: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICUSTAY_ID, CHARTTIME, ITEMID, AMOUNT
(11) labevents: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ITEMID, CHARTTIME, VALUENUM, VALUEUOM
(12) microbiologyevents: RROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, CHARTTIME, SPEC_TYPE_DESC, ORG_NAME
(13) outputevents: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICUSTAY_ID, CHARTTIME, ITEMID, VALUE
(14) patients: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, GENDER, DOB, DOD
(15) prescriptions: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, STARTDATE, ENDDATE, DRUG, DOSE_VAL_RX, DOSE_UNIT_RX, ROUTE
(16) procedures_icd: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICD9_CODE, CHARTTIME
(17) transfers: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICUSTAY_ID, EVENTTYPE, CAREUNIT, WARDID, INTIME, OUTTIME

In the generated code, you can use the following functions:
(1) LoadDB(DBNAME) which loads the database DBNAME and returns the database. The DBNAME can be one of the following: admissions, chartevents, cost, d_icd_diagnoses, d_icd_procedures, d_items, d_labitems, diagnoses_icd, icustays, inputevents_cv, labevents, microbiologyevents, outputevents,patients, prescriptions, procedures_icd, transfers.
(2) FilterDB(DATABASE, CONDITIONS), which filters the DATABASE according to the CONDITIONS and returns the filtered database. The CONDITIONS is a string composed of multiple conditions, each of which consists of the column_name, the relation and the value (e.g., COST<10). The CONDITIONS is one single string (e.g., "admissions, SUBJECT_ID=24971"). Different conditions are separated by '||'.
(3) GetValue(DATABASE, ARGUMENT), which returns a string containing all the values of the column in the DATABASE (if multiple values, separated by ", "). When there is no additional operations on the values, the ARGUMENT is the column_name in demand. If the values need to be returned with certain operations, the ARGUMENT is composed of the column_name and the operation (like COST, sum). Please do not contain " or ' in the argument.
(4) SQLInterpreter(SQL), which interprets the query SQL and returns the result.
(5) Calendar(DURATION), which returns the date after the duration of time (e.g., "-1 year").

Here are some relevant cases:
